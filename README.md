# AmbitionBox-Webscraping-Cleaning-EDA-

Project Title: End-to-End Data Web Scraping & Exploratory Analysis
This project involved the development of a complete Data Pipeline, transitioning from raw unstructured web content to actionable business insights. The workflow followed these key stages:

a. Web Scraping:
1. Leveraged Python and the BeautifulSoup library to systematically crawl targeted website.
2. Parsed complex HTML structures using CSS selectors and tags to extract key data points (e.g., product details, prices, or user reviews).
3. Exported the extracted unstructured data into a structured CSV file format for local storage and portability.

b. Data Wrangling and Preprocessing:
1. Utilised the Pandas library to load and transform the raw CSV data into a clean, analysis-ready DataFrame.
2. Handled data quality issues by identifying and treating missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data types.
3. Performed Data Cleaning to normalize text and format numerical features for statistical accuracy.

c. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Conducted a comprehensive EDA to uncover hidden patterns and trends within the dataset.
2. Generated descriptive statistics and visualisations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
3. Extracted high-level insights, such as identifying market outliers or detecting seasonal trends, to support data-driven decision-making.
